Windows or Mac. 
Linux users must install the software by following the instruction below. 

For development the same installation process can be used. Executables 
can be generated by using "pyinstaller".

    git clone https://github.com/planktontoolbox/plankton-toolbox.git
    cd plankton-toolbox
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the application. 

    cd plankton-toolbox
    source venv/bin/activate
    python3 plankton_toolbox_start.py

Note that you must have the two directories
"plankton_toolbox_data" and "plankton_toolbox_counter" in the same directory
as the "plankton-toolbox_start.py" python file. They can be downloaded from
http://nordicmicroalgae.org/tools 

For Mac users that are using the pre build Mac version these two directories 
should be placed in the users home directory.
